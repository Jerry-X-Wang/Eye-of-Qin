 ## Description

 This is a project to monitor a sleeping classroom and find who is sleeping.

## Why this is called *Eye of Qin*?

In Suzhou High School - SIP, Qin Jiang was the class teacher of the 2024 gifted youth class, and it was the class where we were. Qin told us that he had done an experiment on his students: he monitorred their faces in class time and observed their eyes and hands moving, then compared these behaviours with their scores in exams. However, it was all did manually by him. Inspired by this, we decided to build a system that can automatically detect the state of students in the classroom, to help students study more efficiently. Therefore, we call this project *Eye of Qin*.
