# Description

*Eye of Qin* is a project to detect students in the classroom and identify their state, recording the duration of each student's sleeping and other states, in order to facilitate targeted teaching.

# 简介

“老秦的眼睛”项目旨在检测教室内的学生，并识别学生状态，记录每个学生睡觉等各种状态的持续时间，从而便于进行针对性的教学。


# Why this is called *Eye of Qin*?

In Suzhou High School - SIP, Qin Jiang was the class teacher of the 2024 gifted youth class, and it was the class where we were. Qin told us that he had done an experiment on his students: he monitorred their faces in class time and observed their eyes and hands moving, then compared these behaviours with their scores in exams. However, it was all did manually by him. Inspired by this, we decided to build a system that can automatically detect the state of students in the classroom, to help students study more efficiently. Therefore, we call this project *Eye of Qin*.

# 为什么这个项目叫作“老秦的眼睛”？

在苏州中学园区校，秦江老师是2024级少科班的班主任，这也是我们所在的班级。秦老师曾向我们分享，他对学生做过一个实验：在监控里观察课堂时间上学生的面部表情，观察他们的眼神和手部动作，并将这些行为特征记录下来，与考试成绩进行关联分析。不过，这些观察完全由他人工完成。受此启发，我们决定开发一套能够自动监测学生课堂状态的系统，以帮助学生提升学习效率。因此，我们将这个项目命名为“老秦的眼睛”。
